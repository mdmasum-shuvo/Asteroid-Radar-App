Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size, velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous. In this project, you will apply the skills such as fetching data from the internet, saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, compelling UI.

You will need the NEoWs API which is a free, open source API provided by NASA JPL Asteroid team, as they explain it: â€œIs a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set
